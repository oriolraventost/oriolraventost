## ðŸ‘‹ About Me

I am a Mathematics undergraduate at UPC with a foundation in calculus, linear algebra, probability, statistical inference, and differential equations. My studies have helped me develop careful analytical and problem-solving habits, allowing me to tackle complex mathematical problems with clarity.

I work on data science and machine learning side projects, applying mathematical concepts to real-world problems. I approach each project with curiosity and a willingness to learn, and Iâ€™m eager to continue developing my skills through new challenges and practical experiences.

## ðŸŽ¯ Projects

- [Predict the Introverts from the Extroverts | Kaggle Competition](https://github.com/oriolraventost/Kaggle-Competitions/blob/main/predict-the-introverts-from-the-extroverts.ipynb) - Built a machine learning model to classify individuals as introverts or extroverts based on behavioral and personality trait data using an XGBoost model with stratified cross-validation, achieving 96.96% accuracy and ranking in the top 5.2% of participants.
- [Binary Classification with a Bank Dataset | Kaggle Competition]() - Developed a model to predict the probability of client subscription to bank term deposits using XGBoost and LightGBM with stratified 5-fold cross-validation and blended predictions, achieving a ROC AUC of 0.97443 and ranking in the top 15.7% of participants.
